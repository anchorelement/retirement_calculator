# Retirement Calculator

This is a simple utility written in Python which attempts to predict whether or not your money will last in retirement.  The predictions are based on your input parameters with some randomness around investment returns.  It should be used for entertainment and/or educational purposes only, and not as a replacement for professional financial advice.  Included is a sample configuration file which you can edit to model interesting scenarios.
